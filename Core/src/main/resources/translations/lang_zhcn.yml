# All messages sent in game by this plugin are stored here (and in the future in other files for other languages as
# well). (Correction: permission deny messages live in the plugin.yml file and can only be modified through there)
# This file should not be edited directly, but instead used as a reference for writing message overrides in
#   `language-settings.yml`.
# All messages will have a brief description, and an explanation of what each placeholder represents.
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

#   {0} - The reason the action was denied.

# For when an RTP action is denied because an issue occurred. Ex: an exception occurs while waiting for an rtp location.
#   {0} - The message from the exception that caused this message to appear.
#   Note: This is always followed in console by a stack trace (which can not be configured)

# READABLE-TIME - This is a special case message. Whenever a time needs to be displayed, it will use this for
#   formatting. Also, each 'word' will only be displayed if the associated number value is greater than 0.
# Example: 8675 seconds will be formatted as such: `2 hours, 24 minutes, 35 seconds.` Note the absence of days.
