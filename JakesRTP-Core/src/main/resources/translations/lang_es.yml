# All messages sent in game by this plugin are stored here (and in the future in other files for other languages as well).
# This file should not be edited directly, but instead used as a reference for writing message overrides in
#   `language-settings.yml`.
# All messages will have a brief description, and an explanation of what each placeholder represents.
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# For when an RTP action is denied such as trying to rtp in a world that does not allow rtp.
#   {0} - The reason the action was denied.

# For when an RTP action is denied because an issue occurred. Ex: an exception occurs while waiting for an rtp location.
#   {0} - The message from the exception that caused this message to appear.
#   Note: This is always followed in console by a stack trace (which can not be configured)
not-permitted-major-error: 'Error. No se pudo teletransportar porque: {0} \nPor favor, revise la consola para más información sobre por qué falló la teletransportación.'
# For when the reason an action is denied is that rtp is not enabled in the world.
#   {0} - An identifier that helps with debugging

# For no rtpSettings are found with a given name WHEN SEARCHED BY A SPECIFIC PLAYER
# This will both be displayed when the rtpSettings with the given name do not exist, or the player who ran
#   the `/rtp <settingsName>` command did not have permission to use the settings found.
#   {0} - The given name
no-settings-found-with-name-for-player: 'No hay configuraciones RTP con el nombre {0}'
# For when too many attempts are made by the plugin to find a point with no success.

rtp-settings-no-contain-world: 'Error de Input: La configuración "{0}" no contiene el mundo "{1}" como uno de sus mundos habilitados.'
# For when a given rtpSettings can only land people in one world but another world is requested instead.
#   {0} - The rtpSetting's name
#   {1} - The only valid world name
rtp-settings-must-use-world: 'Error de Input: La configuración "{0}" solo puede teletransportar personas en el mundo "{1}"'
# For when a player needs to wait for a cooldown before running the command again.
#   {0} - The cooldown time (uses READABLE-TIME as defined below)
need-to-wait-for-cooldown:  'Necesitas esperar el cooldown: {0}'
# READABLE-TIME - This is a special case message. Whenever a time needs to be displayed, it will use this for
#   formatting. Also, each 'word' will only be displayed if the associated number value is greater than 0.
# Example: 8675 seconds will be formatted as such: `2 hours, 24 minutes, 35 seconds.` Note the absence of days.
readable-time: '{0}{1}{2}{3}'
readable-time-word-days:    '{0} días, '
readable-time-word-hours:   '{0} horas, '
readable-time-word-minutes: '{0} minutos, '
